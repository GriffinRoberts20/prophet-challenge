# prophet-challenge
  In this challenge, I practiced preparing data and using Prophet to predict the trends in a dataset.
The data in question was the Google trends data and stock close prices for Mercado Libre. I was able to 
identify the peaks and valleys of the Google trends by the hour of day, day of the week, and week of the 
year basis. I was also able to clearly identify a spike in Google trends and stock close price, however 
the two in general seem to have a low if any correllation, even when looking at stock volatility and 
lagged trend data.
